    \caption{AMPERE Northern Hemisphere FAC maps showing the later stages of the 10–11 May 2024 geomagnetic storm. 
    The maps at 18:00 UT and 02:00 UT show strong upward (red) and downward (blue) currents. 
    These saturated colors indicate that region 1 and region 2 field-aligned currents have intensified, 
    reflecting peak FAC activity, an expanded polar cap, and enhanced auroral electrojets during the main and early recovery phases of the storm.}
